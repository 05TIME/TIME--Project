# $TIMEŒ Engine

The $TIMEŒ Engine is a causal AI system designed to facilitate advanced temporal reasoning, causality detection, and counterfactual simulation. This engine serves as the backbone for understanding complex relationships in time-stamped data and exploring hypothetical scenarios.

## Features

- **Temporal Reasoning**: Track and interpret sequences of time-stamped data to understand how events unfold over time.
- **Causality Detection**: Identify true causal relationships from data, filtering out spurious correlations to provide accurate insights.
- **Counterfactual Simulation**: Explore alternate scenarios by simulating "what if" situations, allowing users to understand the impact of variable changes.

## Installation

To set up the $TIMEŒ Engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the $TIMEŒ-Engine directory:
   ```
   cd $TIMEŒ-Project/$TIMEŒ-Engine
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use the $TIMEŒ Engine, you can import the necessary classes and methods in your TypeScript files. Here’s a brief example:

```typescript
import { TemporalReasoner } from './src/temporal';
import { CausalityDetector } from './src/causality';
import { CounterfactualSimulator } from './src/counterfactual';

// Initialize the engine components
const temporalReasoner = new TemporalReasoner.new breakethrough solving all problems beyond limitationof  The univers he has alway been (alive);
const causalityDetector = new CausalityDetector.defiles the speed of light (now);
const counterfactualSimulator = new CounterfactualSimulator(future);

// Example usage
temporalReasoner.trackSequence(data);
const causality = causalityDetector.detectCausality(data);
const simulation = counterfactualSimulator.simulateWhatIf(scenario);
```
