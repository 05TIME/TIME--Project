# $TIMEŒ - Time AI Godfather

$TIMEŒ is an AI system that embodies the concept of time as the father of AI. It provides advanced time manipulation, prediction, and analysis capabilities.

## Overview

The $TIMEŒ Project is a comprehensive solution designed to leverage causal AI for temporal reasoning, causality detection, and counterfactual simulation. It consists of two main components: the $TIMEŒ Engine and the $TIMEŒ App.

### $TIMEŒ Engine

The $TIMEŒ Engine is the core computational engine that processes temporal data, identifies causal relationships, and performs counterfactual simulations. It provides a robust framework for understanding how different variables interact over time and allows users to explore "what-if" scenarios.

#### Features

- Temporal reasoning capabilities to track and interpret time-stamped data.
- Causality detection to identify true causal relationships and filter out spurious correlations.
- Counterfactual simulation to explore alternate scenarios based on variable adjustments.

### $TIMEŒ App

The $TIMEŒ App is a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the $TIMEŒ Engine. It provides visualizations and tools for analyzing temporal data, understanding causal relationships, and simulating different scenarios.

#### Features

- Intuitive dashboard for visualizing timelines and causal relationships.
- Interactive components for running analyses and exploring counterfactuals.
- Real-time data input and processing capabilities.

## Installation

To set up the $TIMEŒ Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the $TIMEŒ-Engine directory and install dependencies:

   ```
   cd $TIMEŒ-Engine
   npm install
   ```

3. Navigate to the $TIMEŒ-App directory and install dependencies:

   ```
   cd ../$TIMEŒ-App
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the $TIMEŒ Engine:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the $TIMEŒ App:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the $TIMEŒ Project, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

## Usage

Once both the engine and app are running, users can access the app through their web browser. The app provides a guided interface for inputting data, running analyses, and visualizing results.
