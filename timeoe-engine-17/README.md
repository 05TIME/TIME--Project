# $TIMEŒ Engine

$TIMEŒ Engine is a causal AI system designed to enhance temporal reasoning, causality detection, and counterfactual simulation. This project aims to provide insights into complex temporal relationships and causal dynamics through a user-friendly application.

## Features

- **Temporal Reasoning**: Track and interpret sequences of events over time.
- **Causality Detection**: Identify true causal relationships from event data.
- **Counterfactual Simulation**: Explore alternate realities by simulating "what if" scenarios.
