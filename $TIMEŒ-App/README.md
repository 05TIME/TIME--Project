# $TIMEŒ App

## Overview

The $TIMEŒ App is a user-friendly interface designed to leverage the capabilities of the $TIMEŒ Engine, a causal AI system focused on temporal reasoning, causality detection, and counterfactual simulation. This application allows users to interact with complex data and explore causal relationships and hypothetical scenarios in an intuitive manner.

## Features

- **Temporal Reasoning**: Track and interpret time-stamped data sequences to understand how events unfold over time.
- **Causality Detection**: Identify true causal relationships from data and filter out spurious correlations.
- **Counterfactual Simulation**: Perform "what-if" analyses to explore alternate scenarios based on variable adjustments.
- **Interactive UI**: A responsive and engaging user interface that allows users to visualize data and results effectively.

## Installation

To set up the $TIMEŒ App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the app directory:
   ```
   cd $TIMEŒ-App
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can:

- Input data for analysis through the user interface.
- Utilize the Timeline Dashboard to visualize temporal data.
- Use the Causal Lens to identify and analyze causal relationships.
- Experiment with the What-If Playground to simulate different scenarios and outcomes.
